In sproutcore, data handling consists of several layer. Some terms.

1) DataSource, connects your DataStore to the backend.
2) DataStore, stores your actual data hashes
3) DataHash, is the raw data sitting in the DataStore
4) Records, is the parent of all model objects. Records are created out of data hashes.
5) StoreKeys, identifies DataHash in the DataStore. Remains the same for the life of a runtime.

DataSource
==========
Basically the thing, that connects you to the backend. This is, what you have to write on your own, but SC gives you a helping hand by providing a DataSource class, which you should inhert from and change stuff. At certains points (see later), DS will be called and asked to do stuff.

store.readDataHash(storeKey)
store.readStatus(storeKey)
store.recordTypeFor(storeKey)
store.idFor(storeKey)
recordType.idFor(storeKey)
