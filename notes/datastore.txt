Store
=====

* Datastore is all about maintaining hashes.
* it is a local in memory store.
* In your application however, you will encounter Records and RecordArrays. Your Model objects.
* These are wrapping datahashes.
* Records are returned, when you require one specific Object.
* RecordArrays are returned, when you construct a query. It is an SC.array of Records, but these are created in a lazy fashion.

* dataHashes should contain only primitive types
* support for mapping relations
